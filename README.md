# flowcrypt-mobile-node

This repo hosts code a NodeJS instance meant to run in the backround in our Android and iOS apps. Some of the code is also reused in FlowCrypt Browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox, and on our web.

It's based on <a href="https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile">nodejs-mobile</a> and it allows us to share our core functionality across platforms.
